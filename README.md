# HealthBit
The vast majority of hospitals cannot safely share their data with each other, resulting in doctors spending more time writing than helping patients. Health Bit enables clinics and private medical practitioners to safely and easily access patient records, track and monitor patient progress remotely, and exchange information securely with colleagues.

## Installation

Setup Flutter in your system (https://flutter.dev/)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SaujanBindukar/HealthBit.git
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
